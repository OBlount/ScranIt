  <strong>Deciding on tonight’s moves</strong>
</p>

---

## Description

Ever asked _"What are we eating tonight?"_ and all you get back is a dreary _"Don't know."_. Use ScranIt to cherry pick tonight’s moves.
Grab your partner and create a room! We use general locations to generate close-by restaurants - you won't have to travel far. You can choose:

-   :pushpin: Your location
-   :pushpin: Your partner's location
-   :pushpin: 'Meet in the Middle' which generates a location between you and your partner

Once a room is created, send the url to your friend and play the game! Both of you will have cards to swipe left or right to. So, get swiping!
Once both players have finished the game, you will get (hopefully) matches. Only thing left now is to enjoy your meal.

`git clone https://github.com/OBlount/ScranIt.git`

## TODO

**Front End**

-   :pushpin: Add a 'copy-to-clipboard' url button
-   :pushpin: Make ready button which sends geo-location to database
-   :pushpin: Create the swipe game!
-   :pushpin: Display favourable restaurants to the user
-   :pushpin: Mobile friendly UI
